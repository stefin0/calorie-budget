# Calorie Tracker

## What is it?

Calorie tracker is a website that calculates the calories that you need to eat per day in order to achieve your goals. Your calories will be calculated using the Mifflin-St. Jeor Equation. Factors include: gender, current weight, height, age, estimated body fat composition, lifestyle and training frequency, gym experience level, and your goal to lose fat and/or build muscle.
